# Middleman + VueJS: Bootstap your prototyping process.

### The project includes:
* [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) - Ruby static site generator
* [VueJS 2](https://vuejs.org/) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - NPM is the package manager for JavaScript and the worldâ€™s largest software registry
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - Module bundler and pain in the ass

### Running the project
Follow the instructions on how to install the libs mentioned above. Once you have those locked down, this is what you'll do:

Once you have successfully cloned and are in the project directory, run `npm install` to install the javascript packages. Then run `bundle install` to install the gems needed for Middleman.

Ok, almost there. After all the libs for both NPM and Middleman have been added to the project, run `bundle exec middleman server`. This will start the project and you can start prototyping!
